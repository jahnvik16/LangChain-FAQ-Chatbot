## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using LangChain, Hugging Face models, and a vector database (Chroma).
It combines your uploaded OpenAI PDF with additional AI/ML FAQs to create a powerful FAQ assistant that retrieves contextually relevant answers using embeddings-based search and a local LLM.

Full README is provided in the conversation above.
